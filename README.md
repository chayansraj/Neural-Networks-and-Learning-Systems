# Neural-Networks-and-Learning-Systems
Solving problems using different machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning, classification, pattern recognition and high-dimensional data analysis. 

* Supervised learning: neural networks, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, ensemble methods, boosting. 
* Unsupervised learning: patterns in high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction, clustering, principal component analysis, independent component analysis.
* Reinforcement learning:  Markov models, Q-learning.
